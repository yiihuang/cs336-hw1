    "# 1. Assignment Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will build all the components needed to train a standard Transformer language model (LM) from scratch and train some models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you will implement\n",
    "1. Byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer (§2)\n",
    "2. Transformer language model (LM) (§3)\n",
    "3. The cross-entropy loss function and the AdamW optimizer (§4)\n",
    "4. The training loop, with support for serializing and loading model and optimizer state (§5)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you will run\n",
    "1. Train a BPE tokenizer on the TinyStories dataset.\n",
    "2. Run your trained tokenizer on the dataset to convert it into a sequence of integer IDs.\n",
    "3. Train a Transformer LM on the TinyStories dataset.\n",
    "4. Generate samples and evaluate perplexity using the trained Transformer LM.\n",
    "5. Train models on OpenWebText and submit your attained perplexities to a leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you can use\n",
    "We expect you to build these components from scratch. In particular, you may **not** use any definitions from `torch.nn`, `torch.nn.functional`, or `torch.optim` except for the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `torch.nn.Parameter`\n",
    "- Container classes in `torch.nn` (e.g., `Module`, `ModuleList`, `Sequential`, etc.)\n",
    "- The `torch.optim.Optimizer` base class\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use any other PyTorch definitions. If you would like to use a function or class and are not sure whether it is permitted, feel free to ask on Slack. When in doubt, consider whether using it compromises the “from-scratch” ethos of the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statement on AI tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompting LLMs such as ChatGPT is permitted for low-level programming questions or high-level conceptual questions about language models, but using it directly to solve the problem is **prohibited**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We strongly encourage you to disable AI autocomplete (e.g., Cursor Tab, GitHub Copilot) in your IDE when completing assignments (non-AI autocomplete, e.g., function-name completion, is fine). AI autocomplete often makes it harder to engage deeply with the content.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **`cs336_basics/*`**: Your code lives here. There’s no code provided—you can implement everything from scratch.\n",
    "2. **`adapters.py`**: Defines required functionality your code must expose. For each feature (e.g., scaled dot-product attention), fill in the corresponding hook (e.g., `run_scaled_dot_product_attention`) by invoking your implementation. *Do not put substantive logic here; it’s glue code.*\n",
    "3. **`test_*.py`**: Tests you must pass (e.g., `test_scaled_dot_product_attention`) that call hooks defined in `adapters.py`. **Do not edit** the tests.\n",

You’ll find these “low-resource tips” in a blue box (like this one). Even if you are an enrolled Stanford student with access to the course machines, these tips may help you iterate faster and save time, so we recommend you read them!\n",

    "## 2.2 Unicode Encodings\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Unicode standard defines a mapping from characters to code points (integers), it’s impractical to train tokenizers directly on Unicode codepoints, since the vocabulary would be prohibitively large (around 150K items) and sparse (since many characters are quite rare). Instead, we’ll use a Unicode **encoding**, which converts a Unicode character into a sequence of **bytes**. The Unicode standard itself defines three encodings: **UTF-8**, **UTF-16**, and **UTF-32**, with **UTF-8** being the dominant encoding for the Internet (more than 98% of all webpages).\n",
    "\n",
    "To encode a Unicode string into UTF-8, we can use the `encode()` function in Python. To access the underlying byte values for a Python `bytes` object, we can iterate over it (e.g., call `list()`).

    "\n",
    "While byte-level tokenization can alleviate the out-of-vocabulary issues faced by word-level tokenizers, tokenizing text into **bytes** results in extremely long input sequences. This slows down model training: a sentence with 10 words might be ~10 tokens in a word-level LM, but could be 50+ tokens in a character/byte-level model (depending on word lengths). Longer sequences increase compute per step, and modeling long byte sequences creates longer-term dependencies.\n",

    "\n",
    "- A byte-level tokenizer’s vocabulary has **256** entries (byte values 0–255).\n",
    "- A subword tokenizer trades a **larger vocabulary** for **shorter sequences** (better compression).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Choosing subword units.**  \n",
    "Sennrich et al. (2016), following Gage (1994), propose **byte-pair encoding (BPE)**—a compression algorithm that iteratively merges the most frequent adjacent pair into a new token. Repeated merges add subword tokens to maximize compression: frequent words may become single subword units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subword tokenizers built via BPE are often called **BPE tokenizers**. In this assignment, we implement a **byte-level BPE** tokenizer: vocabulary items are bytes or merged byte sequences, combining robust OOV handling with manageable sequence lengths. Constructing the BPE vocabulary is called **“training”** the tokenizer.\n"

    "## 2.4 BPE Tokenizer Training\n",
    "\n",
    "The BPE tokenizer training procedure consists of three main steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vocabulary initialization\n",
    "The tokenizer vocabulary is a one-to-one mapping from bytestring token to integer ID. Since we are training a **byte-level** BPE tokenizer, our initial vocabulary is simply the set of all bytes. Because there are 256 possible byte values, the initial vocabulary size is **256**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-tokenization\n",
    "Once you have a vocabulary, you could, in principle, count how often bytes occur next to each other in your text and begin merging them starting with the most frequent pair of bytes. However, this is quite computationally expensive, since you would have to take a full pass over the corpus for each merge. In addition, directly merging bytes across the corpus may result in tokens that differ only in punctuation (e.g., “dog!” vs. “dog.”), which would get completely different token IDs even though they are highly semantically similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this, we **pre-tokenize** the corpus. You can think of this as a coarse-grained tokenization over the corpus that helps us count how often pairs of characters appear. For example, the word `'text'` might be a pre-token that appears 10 times. In this case, when we count how often the characters `t` and `e` appear next to each other, we will see that the word `text` has `t` and `e` adjacent and we can increment their count by 10 instead of scanning the whole corpus. Since we’re training a byte-level BPE model, each pre-token is represented as a sequence of UTF-8 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original BPE implementation of Sennrich et al. (2016) pre-tokenizes by simply splitting on whitespace (i.e., `s.split(\" \")`). In contrast, we will use a **regex-based** pre-tokenizer (used by GPT-2; Radford et al., 2019) from the tiktoken project:  \n",
